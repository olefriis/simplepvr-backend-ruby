1.1.0
- Proper log-in dialog, instead of the browser's own HTTP Basic Authentication dialog.
- Updated to Twitter Bootstrap 3 (and newer versions of other JS libraries).
- Using CDNs for most of the JavaScript, reducing the size of the gem.
- Possibility to run server in HTTPS.
- More extensive use of XMLTV data: categories, actors, directors, images, etc.
- Recording subdirectories now use timestamps as names instead of a sequence, since XBMC
  would get a little bit confused with new recordings in old directories.

1.0.0
- Initial release. Everything is working nicely.
